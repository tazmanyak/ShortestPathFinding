# ShortestPathFinding
Shortest Path Finding A*Star Heuristic Approach

This is actually not finished project about A*star Shortest Path Finding Algorithm. I'm still working on it and it is good to share the idea behind it.


I will not share "reader class" since it is not coded by me and its belong to IT company that i might not have permission to share. So, look at it as if you know reader.h and reader.c. You can understand the logic behind it even though you donot see reader class.


##What is it about ? 

The purpose of this project is to find the best possible paths from initial to end node. You know the coordinates of nodes and neighbourhoods of each node. When the best path is found, the next step is to generate SVG to show on the real MAP so that we can visualize the output.


##What it is included in this project ? 

I coded Node and SVG generator class. The algorithm is in the "main.c". When you look at it, there are comments on each line so that you can understand what is really going on about it.
